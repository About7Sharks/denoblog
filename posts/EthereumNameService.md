# Ethereum Name Service 

## Ever come across a weird string that looks like this?
> 0xa485b3e631c02834A73349CFA6c5543bB0796985

Well that’s actually someone’s public Identifier, that Id is mine! It’s peoples way of finding me on the ethereum blockchain. Isn’t it ugly 🐛

## How do we fix this?

The current internet we’re used to actually had this same issue. When you go to you browser and type in https://google.com there’s a protocol on the internet called *DNS* which basically maps a webserver like 64.233.160.0 to google.com giving you a readable format and something you can actually remember and type. 

## So how does Ethereum fix this?

The amazing people working on the ethereum network have been working on a service called [ENS](https://ens.domains/) a way to map that ugly sting to 
> zacarlin.eth 

Isn’t that so much nicer 🦋

Typing zacarlin.eth into applications allows you to interact with me through the ethereum blockchain in some interesting ways! 

 - Type that into a wallet app to pay me directly
 - Type that into a chat app to message me
 - Type that into a browser to view my site in a uncensorable way
 - Type zacarlin.eth@ethmail.cc into your email client to email me

As the ethereum blockchain matures and sees more adoption, you can expect many more things to come in this exciting future. If you want to setup your own name visit https://app.ens.domains/ to get started. Feel free to send me what your create through my .eth domain of course ;)

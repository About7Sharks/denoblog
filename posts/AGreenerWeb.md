# A Greener Web
### **Simplicity**
We should strive to have the simplest solution to the most complex problem. Even if this simple solution is abstracted onto a more complicated platform, we should still be able to make the most of it using the simplest possible interface as well.

### **Accessibility**
We should strive to make our software accessible to all. This is a key part of our mission to make the world a better place. It's easy to use huge libraries but remember that takes energy to send to the client. Even a simple google search has been estimated to use enough energy to power a lightbulb for an hour. It's too easy to bloat our codebase with unnecessary features that are not needed.

## What's been up
I've been working at Dogwood logic for the past year; a company developing applications built using the DID ([Decentralized Identifiers](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#identifier)) and EDV ([Encrypted Data Vaults](https://identity.foundation/edv-use-cases/)) technolgies that have recentley been growing in the cryptographic communitiy.

## At home stuff
This is where i loose 99% of people. Coming from a background in forex and then studying computer science I naturally gravitated towards the first use case of blockchains which were ledgers of who holds what asset (Bitcoin), which is a fantastic and very practical use case for this amazing tech. Humans need to know that random money isn't being added to the supply without consenuses. We learned that in 2008 and hence forth the ferderal reserve (not a government entity but a bunch of banks) have been quite transparent about what they are about to do with the monetary supply. enuf of dat stuff though, crypto moves fast like really fast. Going to a bank is medeval now days. There a permisonaless software that anyone can use that allows you to take a loan in 3 clicks...

I went to the bank a few months ago and there wasn't any cash at that atm... That's insanse in web3 world. Theres like 20 sites I can use to get Usd if Btc or Eth isn't accepted for my needs. I'm sorry but that can't be understated. 

I've been quite intrested in other chains and how some of the baseline protocols allow for some sophisticated moves. There are simple (5 click) strategies that you can use to not only survive but thrive in any market. It's actually way easier to do so than traditional finance. I like most people who have traded have suffered the unfortunate loss of picking the wrong trade. Sometime we have the reserve to set a stop loss (auto exit the trade) other times we foolishly add to our margin until the enevitable liquidation and loss of funds. YEAH that stuff doesn't quite happen in defi if you choose. Index coop has been creating an intresting set of tools that allow traders to hold leverage positions in the form of an erc20 token that doesn't actually have a liquidation price. One could even provide liquidity to a dex and in a lp pool of the base token to reduce there leverage to 1.5x while earning trading fees that would normally be reserved to a centralized exchange.

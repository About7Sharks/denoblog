## This site

I made this as a way to improve my React and Typescript skills, also to
mess around with some new decentralized services. If you're viewing this
from https://zacarlin.eth.link or https://zacarlin.crypto you are seeing
this via the IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) and utilizing the
Ethereum Name Services or Unstoppable domains; making this site **Uncensorable**.
